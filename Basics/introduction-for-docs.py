# python 


#  Python is a high level( high level languages are those languages thar are easily understandable and readable for programmers and uses natural language construcs and abstructions to hide low level details ) , interpret ( that gets executed by interpreter means there is no compiler to complie the code before hence can be used to see results real time executes programme line by line ) , interactive () , object oriented , open sourced programming language.

# It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.

# Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.

#  Python is designed to be highly readable.
#  It uses English keywords frequently where as other languages use punctuation , and it has fewer syntactical constructions than other languages.
#  Python is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer specially when they are working in Web Development Domain.
#  Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more efficiently.
#  There are two major Python versions Python 2 and Python 3. Both are quite different.
#  Python 2.x is legacy , Python 3.x is the present and future of the language.
#  Python 3.0 was released in 2008. The final 2.x version 2.7 release came out in mid 2010 , with a statement of extended support for this end-of-life release.
#  Python 2.7 will not be maintained past 2020.
#  Python 3.0 was designed to be backwards incompatible , many projects have not yet made the switch , as it would involve rewriting tens of thousands of lines of code.
#  Python 3.0 makes breaking changes to the language , but many projects have been slow to port their code to the new version , or are prevented from doing so by their dependencies.

# Where do we use python ? 

# 1. Web Development : Python can be used to make web applications at many levels of complexity.
# 2. Game Development : Python is also used in development of interactive games.
# 3. Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence : Python is widely used in AI , ML and Deep Learning.
# 4. Data Science and Data Visualization : Python is used to perform data analysis , create beautiful visualizations and perform machine learning.
# 5. Desktop GUI : Python is used to build desktop applications.
# 6. Web Scraping Applications : Python is used to build web scraping applications to extract data from websites.
# 7. Business Applications : Python is also used to build applications that do business related tasks.
# 8. Audio and Video Applications : Python is used to build applications that can read , write and play sound and videos.
# 9. Embedded Applications : Python is also used in embedded applications.
# 10. 3D CAD Applications : Python is also used in 3D CAD applications.



# python is a dynamically types language that ..... here answer dynamically typed vs static stype



# Go to python.org to download python

# what is precedence ------ > precedence is the condition of giving importance to someone over someone (the condition of being considered more important than someone or something else; priority in importance, order, or rank. definition -- google )

# now download a desired ide for code writting editing and manupulating

# now make a folder where you will keep you python files hirarchyly and it will keep your files clean

#  then make a file called programmehelloworld.py

#! notice that you have to write the .py extension after the python file it's a convention ( conventions are widely known or accepted standars, practices or rules that are follewed in a pratical field or groud of people or community or )

# Python Indentation

# Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.

# Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.

# Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.

# first write this instruction into your text editor 

print("Hello, World!")

# now write the smallest expression 
# 2 + 2 


# why python is popular 
# 1 for it's design philosophy ( readability , well indented )
# 2 batteries included <fun turm> ( many function are already there to do the tasks smoothly we don't have to re-invent the wheel they are abstructed away by python inbuilt  --- )
# 3 free and open source ( python is free and open source and it's community is very large and active )
# 4 portability ( python is portable means it can be run on any platform like windows , linux , mac , raspberry pi etc. )
# 5 general purpose ( supports many programming paradigms we can make many things )



# python is case sensitive

# now let's understand what we are doing here 
# we are using a function called print() to print something on the screen
# print() is a function that takes a string as an argument and prints it on the screen
# a string is a sequence of characters enclosed in single or double quotes
# print() is a built-in function in python


# and why we should be talking like this
